This repository contains the Microsoft Exploratory Film power point which features the question: how can we help microsoft make a movie? In addition it provides data analysis on film with projections gathered from the domestic gross and production. It also features some data about the genres in each film.

<h2> Business Problem </h2>

We will make recommendations for Microsoft's new film studio. 

We'll consider the type of movie, the budget, and how the audience will rate the movie. 

We will then analyze the given data sets and explore what are the ultimate avenues to take.

<h2> Data Comprehension</h2>

Data used was from 
IMDB
Rotten Tomatoes
Box Office Mojo

We will take a glance at how much money a movie has made domestically, at the production value, and finally at the rating.

<h2> Result 1 - Movie Genres </h2>

The graph shows us what is the key genre element per film, if they have some sort of element, then its marked down. Here we have discovered that most movies have an element of Documentary and Drama. We have discovered that Documentary, Drama, and Comedy are the top elements that compose all the movies.

<h2> Result 2 - Return on Investment </h2>

<h2> Result 3 - Ratings </h2>

I managed to get the ROI and place them on top of the bars. Also I found how to put random text within the graph as well as learned about how to put numbers on top of the bars.

<h2> Results </h2> 

The movie should have a few elements of Drama, Comedy, or Documentary.
Movies such as Documentary, News, Biography are generally rated highly as opposed to Horror which is more lucrative.
Movies that have a lower or medium budget have a  higher chance to have more ROI.

<h2> Next Steps </h2>

Obtain getting new data about movie production which would be helpful in the future.
